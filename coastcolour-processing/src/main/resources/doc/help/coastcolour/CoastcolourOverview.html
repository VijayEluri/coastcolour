<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
    The CoastColour Processors provide...
</p>

<h3>User Interfaces</h3>

<p>
    The CoastColour Processors can be invoked from the VISAT 'Processing --> Thematic Water Processing'
    sub-menu by selecting
    the <b>CoastColour Processors (MERIS)...</b> entry, or in batch mode by using the command line
    tool <i><code>gpt</code></i> (Graph Processing Tool) which is located
    in the BEAM <code>bin</code> directory.
</p>

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>
    TODO: L1P  here

    The IdePix tool for water pixel classification was developed in the frame of the ESA DUE project 'CoastColour' [1], and
    the ESA OceanColour CCI project [2]. The classification is mainly based on the algorithms described in [3], chapter 5.
