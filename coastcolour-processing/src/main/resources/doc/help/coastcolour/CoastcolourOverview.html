<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
    The CoastColour Processors were developed within the ESA DUE CoastColour Project, which was launched by the
    European Space Agency to fully exploit the potential of the MERIS instrument
    for remote sensing of the coastal zone. The CoastColour project website [1] serves as an entry point to
    to all kinds of detailed information on the project. A summary of algorithms, processing steps as well as
    product specifications can be found in the CoastColour Product User Guide [2].
</p>

<h3>User Interfaces</h3>

<p>
    The CoastColour Processors can be invoked from the VISAT 'Processing --> Thematic Water Processing'
    sub-menu by selecting
    the <b>CoastColour Processors (MERIS)...</b> entry, or in batch mode by using the command line
    tool <i><code>gpt</code></i> (Graph Processing Tool) which is located
    in the BEAM <code>bin</code> directory.

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

<p>
    The 'Pre-Processing and Pixel Classification...' processor (also referred as 'L1P' processor throughout this
    documentation) provides a refinement of top of atmosphere radiance and a pixel classification.
    The pixel classification is based on the algorithm used in the
    <it>IdePix tool</it> which was developed in the
    frame of the CoastColour project and the ESA OceanColour CCI project [3]. The
    <it>IdePix tool</it> is available as a separate BEAM processor.
</p>

<p>
    The 'Atmospheric Correction...' processor (also referred as 'L2R' processor) provides an atmosphere
    and sun glint corection based on a neural network approach.
</p>

<p>
    The 'In-Water Processing...' processor (also referred as 'L2W' processor) provides water properties
    in Case 2 waters derived from various neural network approaches.
