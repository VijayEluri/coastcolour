CostColour Data Processors
==========================


This is the source code repository for the data processors used in the CoastColour project of the European Space Agency (ESA, Data User Element DUE).

It provides these data processors as plugins to [BEAM](http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam/)
and to the [Calvalus on-demand processing system](http://coastcolour.org/products.html).

CoastColour processing applies to water pixels observed by the Envisat MERIS instrument and includes a radiometric correction and pixel classification (Level-1P processing), an atmospheric correction (Level-2R processing) and retrieval of water parameters (Level-2W processing).

Full information about the project can be found on the CoastColour website at http://www.coastcolour.org/.
