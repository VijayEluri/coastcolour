This is the source code repository for the data processors used in the **CoastColour project** supported and 
funded by the European Space Agency (ESA).

It provides these data processors as plugins to [BEAM](http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam/) and to the
[Calvalus on-demand processing system](http://www.coastcolour.org/ccprocessing/calvalus.jsp).

CoastColour processing applies to water pixels observed by the Envisat MERIS instrument and includes
a radiometric correction and pixel classification (Level-1P processing), an atmospheric correction
(Level-2R processing) and retrieval of water parameters (Level-2W processing). The algorithms are based
on an artificial neural network approach.

Full information about the project can be found on the CoastColour website at http://www.coastcolour.org/.
